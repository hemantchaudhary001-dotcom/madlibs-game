# Mad Libs Game ðŸŽ‰

A beginner-friendly Python project that generates silly stories based on user input. Great for practicing string manipulation and input handling.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
- The program asks the user for words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
- It inserts those words into a pre-written story template
- The result is a fun, randomized story!

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemantchaudhary001/madlibs-game.git
