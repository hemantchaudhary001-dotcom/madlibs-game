# Mad Libs Game 🎉

A beginner-friendly Python project that generates silly stories based on user input. Great for practicing string manipulation and input handling.

## 💡 How It Works
- The program asks the user for words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
- It inserts those words into a pre-written story template
- The result is a fun, randomized story!

## 🛠 Technologies Used
